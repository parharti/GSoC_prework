#  Multichannel Cell Candidate Detection â€“ GSoC 2025 Prototype

This notebook demonstrates a prototype implementation of the **cell candidate detection pipeline** described in my GSoC 2025 proposal for the [Cellfinder](https://github.com/brainglobe/cellfinder) project under the **BrainGlobe** ecosystem.

---

##  Objective

To simulate and test **cell candidate detection** across an **arbitrary number of imaging channels** using synthetic brain-like data.

This serves as a foundational step toward enabling **multi-channel-aware classification** in Cellfinder, which is currently limited to 2 channels (signal + background).

---

##  What's Implemented

- âœ… Synthetic **3D brain image** loading (3 channels)
- âœ… Blob detection using `skimage.feature.blob_log` on:
  - Individual channels
  - Averaged combination of multiple channels
- âœ… Feature extraction: Blob **radius**
- âœ… **Z-score normalization** of features per channel
- âœ… **Combined feature vector** creation from all channels
- âœ… Clean **visualizations** (blobs overlaid on grayscale slice)

---

##  Why This Matters

This prototype demonstrates the viability of:
- Detecting candidates from **N-channel input**
- Creating a **combined feature representation**
- Preparing input for a future **multi-class classifier**

It aligns directly with **Week 1â€“2 deliverables** from my [GSoC 2025 proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H7DuvaXul9I2jDgQjpWhkmfbRYuMmFH4/view?usp=sharing).
